<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Don't think that this site is associated with Y Combinator. It isn't, I just felt the name clearly expressed the sites purpose.</p>
<p>If it wouldn't meet the guidelines on Hacker News, it doesn't meet the guidelines here.</p>
<p>Don't use wiki privelledges in abusvie ways. Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>
<h4>What To Submit</h4>
<p>On Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting enough to read multiple times. This includes more than question and answer threads: anything that can repeatedly gratify intellectual curiosity will do.</p>
<p>Off Topic: The usual link bait about politics and the newly released features of popular brands like Apple. Videos of pranks and disasters. Cute images. Things that have not produced any discussion. In general if it wasn't welcomed on Hacker News it probably isn't welcome here.</p>
<h4>In Submissions</h4>
<p>Titles should not be link bait. Use the title guidlines of Hacker News if you don't understand what this means.</p>
<p>Please tag submissions so that they will be more easily found.</p>
<p>Submissions of things that have already been discussed before are fine. Just edit the discussions so that they link to each other.</p>
<h4>In Comments</h4>
<p>Use the wiki features to bring the site closer to the guidlines of Hacker News.</p>
<p>When people are name calling while disagreeing, remove the name calling, but don't harm the arguments.</p>
<p>Don't include a signature in any of your posts.</p>
<p>Don't use another persons comment as a way to sell yourself.</p>
<p>Resist complaining about the edits of others. Assume the other person was trying to do good.</p>
<p>Don't encourage fighting. Baiting edits and down votes isn't the point. The point is to create something of value collectiely.</p>
