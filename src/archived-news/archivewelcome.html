<h4>Welcome to Hacker Archives</h4>
<p><a href="http://archives.notycombinator.com/">Hacker Archives</a> is a bit different from from other Q&A sites, so we'd appreciate it if you read the <a href="http://arhives.notycombinator.com/arhiveguidelines.html">site guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>HA is an experiment. Usually content that leaves the front page of Hacker News becomes lost to all but search engines. These search engines introduce enough noise that finding things of quality can be a pain. Our hypothesis is that this is not inevitable - that by making a concious effort to resist such noise we can keep good content from being lost.</p>
<p>We don't know whether this hypothesis is correct, which is why this is being tested.</p>
<p>Basically there are two rules here: submit only high quality Hacker News discussions and clean up rude and dumb comments using the sites wiki features.</p>
<p>A high quality discussion should usually be a Q&A thread since that is the main focus of the site. That doesn't mean that is all you can submit. Anything that is full of deeply interesting comments will do.</p>
<p>What does deeply interesting mean? It means stuff that teaches you about the world. A comment on how someone likes a web framework isn't very interesting, but one which goes deeper into the nuances that make the framework useful might qualify.</p>
<p>The worst thing to submit is something that nobody should want to read in a few months. That means posts about the newest thing from Google, Facebook, or Microsoft shouldn't be submitted. If you let stuff like that into the archives your polluting them with noise which hides more useful records.</p>
<p>One of the most important principle on HA is to clean up unthoughtful clutter. Thoughtful in both senses: both civil and substantial.</p>
<p>The test for substance is a lot like the test for submission. Make sure it is teaching something. Make sure that we're providing more information about the topic, ancedotal or otherwise. Cull out the comments which are needleessly aggressive or emotive. Things like "LOL!" or "Thats retarded!" rarely increase signal and encourage unproductive behaviors.</p>
<p>Empty comments can be okay if they are signalling quality. "Thanks" can let someone know that people have found the comment helpful. What is especially discouraged is fluff that doesn't give any signal. Doubly so if it is also negative.</p>
<p>Which brings us to another important principle on HA: preservation. Since long before the web, valuable insight has been lost. Sometimes literally and other times due to being hidden in junk, like the book that explains every mystery your interested in that you will find in the library that contains every possible book. The principle here is to prevent some of that loss. This doesn't mean you can't update and remove. It means you should take actions that will benefit the next person who searches the archives.</p>
